# Adding Community Projects to the CLIP App

This guide provides instructions on how to add your own projects to the CLIP app repository. By contributing your projects, you can showcase your work, collaborate with others, and extend the functionality of the CLIP app.

## Project Structure

To create a new community project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project inside the `community_projects` folder. Choose a descriptive name for your project directory.

2. Inside your project directory, create the following files and directories:
   - `your_project_name.py`: This file should contain your main application code.
   - `requirements.txt`: If your project has external dependencies, list all the required packages here, one per line.
   - `README.md`: Create a readme file with information about your project (see the Documentation section below).
   - `resources/`: If your project requires additional resources (e.g., models, images, datasets), create this directory and place the necessary files here.
   - `download_resources.sh`: If your project requires downloading large files or datasets, create a shell script with the necessary download commands. This script will be executed during the project setup.

## Using the CLIP App Infrastructure

To leverage the CLIP app infrastructure in your project, follow these guidelines:

1. Import the necessary modules from the CLIP app. For example:

```python
from clip_app.text_image_matcher import TextImageMatcher
```

2. Utilize the existing functionality provided by the CLIP app, such as the `TextImageMatcher` class, to perform text-image matching or other tasks relevant to your project.

3. Integrate your custom logic and functionality into the CLIP app pipeline. You can modify the existing code or create new classes and functions as needed.

## Documentation

To ensure that others can understand and use your project, create a `README.md` file in your project directory. This file should include:

- Overview: Provide a brief summary of your project, explaining its purpose and functionality.
- Setup Instructions: Explain how to set up the project, including any dependencies that need to be installed and any necessary configuration steps. Mention that the `download_resources.sh` script will be executed during setup.
- Usage: Provide examples and instructions on how to run your project. Include command-line arguments, if applicable, and explain the expected inputs and outputs.

## Resource Downloads

If your project requires downloading large files or datasets, create a `download_resources.sh` script in your project directory. This script should contain the necessary commands to download the required resources. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Download pre-trained model
wget -P resources/ https://example.com/model.pkl

# Download dataset
wget -P resources/ https://example.com/dataset.zip
unzip resources/dataset.zip -d resources/
```

Make sure to provide clear instructions in your `README.md` file on how to execute the `download_resources.sh` script during project setup.

## Submitting Your Project

Once your project is complete and properly documented, you can submit it to the CLIP app repository by following these steps:

1. Fork the CLIP app repository on GitHub.

2. Create a new branch in your forked repository for your project.

3. Add your project directory and all the necessary files to the `community_projects` folder in your branch.

4. Create a pull request from your branch to the main CLIP app repository. Provide a clear description of your project and any relevant information in the pull request.

5. The CLIP app maintainers will review your pull request. They may provide feedback or request changes. Be responsive to their comments and make the necessary adjustments.

6. Once your pull request is approved, your project will be merged into the main CLIP app repository, and it will be available for others to use and explore.

## Support and Feedback

If you have any questions, need assistance, or want to provide feedback regarding your community project, please open an issue in the CLIP app repository. The maintainers and the community will be happy to help you and provide guidance.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to seeing the exciting projects you will add to the CLIP app!
